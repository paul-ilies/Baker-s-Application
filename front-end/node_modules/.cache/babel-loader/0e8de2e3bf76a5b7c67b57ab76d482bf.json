Lower hydration rates (e.g., 50–57%) are typical for bagels and pretzels, and medium hydration levels (58–65%) are typical for breads and rolls.Higher hydration levels are used to produce more and larger holes, as is common in artisan breads such as baguettes or ciabatta. Doughs are also often classified by the terms stiff, firm, soft, and slack.Batters are more liquid doughs. Muffins are a type of drop batter while pancakes are a type of pour batter.\"\n}, {\n  id: 3,\n  question: \"HOW TO USE THE SIMPLE DOUGH CALCULATOR\",\n  explanation: \"This calculator was build to
